This is a modified approach to exisiting Chest Radiograph Classification and Visualization methods. Chest radiograph classification is a fundamental diagnostic tool for respiratory diseases, with the potential to enhance early detection and treatment. The proposed approach was to classify chest radiographs into four categories: ‘pneumonia’, ‘normal’, lung opacity, and COVID-19, using six deep neural networks (DNNs) and creating a multi-level ensemble of the two 3-model ensemble. For localization/visualization of the key data points, Grad-CAM, Occlusion Sensitivity & Saliency Mapping were used to visualize the individual data points in the radiograph that contributed to the classification. For convenience of classification and visualization , a UI was developed using Gradio where the final model classifies the input radiograph and gives the visualization of the infection localized area.
